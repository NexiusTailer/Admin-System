# [Admin System](https://pawno.su/showthread.php?t=113051)

This is the administration system that has a lot of opportunities and very simple and clear in use at the same time.

## Features
* Multi-level spectate system
* Panel for administrators when you click on a player in Tab
* General admin panel with items depending on the level
* Ability to specify several players in one command at once
* Messages of administration's actions are displayed only for administrators and the specified player
* Interaction with RCon (logged into RCon become administrators)
* Ability to cancel the last typed command
* Dynamic panel with suspected players

## Commands
Some commands allow you to enter keywords instead of parameters, for example, "/spec off" will do the same as the command "/specoff".  
Also you can omit the parameters in some commands, so then the command will work on the one who typed it.  
The commands will work on any cmd processor! (except rCmd).
